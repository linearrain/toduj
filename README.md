# Toduj
### What is that?

Toduj is a simple terminal Rust-written todo list, based on saving the data to csv format, ideal for table reading. Contains two basic operations, deletion and marking the task as complete, which crosses the task out, as in notepad.

Available in English, Slovak, Ukrainian and Czech languages. More of them could come soon.

### How to use?

Compile the program with rust *cargo* and run in with ```cargo run```. Type in preffered language code, for example: "ua". After the following operations, you can either type '1' or '2' to see or create a task respectively.
If you need to go back to the start menu, while being in 1st mode, type "back", if you need to create a new task, "add". More on that, just type "help" after selecting the first mode.
